                  <p>So, let's get the show on the road.&nbsp; Just look up at the top there and be on your way to some z/OS <a href="asm">assembler</a> and <a href="rexx">Rexx</a> projects.&nbsp; Heck, you might even find a useful <a href="zlinux">zLinux</a> patch or two.</p>
                  <p>Or you can look right here to see just how lazy I really am.</p>
                  <br/>

                  <table class="tbl">
                    {%  for post in site.posts %}
                    <tr>
                      <td class="col1">{{ post.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}</td>
                      <td class="col2">{{ post.content }}
                    </tr>
                    {% endfor %}
                  </table>
