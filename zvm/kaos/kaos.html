                  <p>KAOS is a small system that is primarily designed to manage the startup
                     of guests within the z/VM environment after an IPL.  It utilizes IBM's
                     Operations Manager for its message and timer triggering.</p>
                  <p>It may also be used as an extension to Operations Manager to provide
                     conditional execution of the various Operations Manager commands.</p>
