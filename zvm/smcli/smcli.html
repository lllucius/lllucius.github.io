                  <h2>{{page.title}}</h2>
                  <p>smcli is a bash script that provides a command line interface to the
                     z/VM System Management API.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both TCP/IP and IUCV transport mechanisms
                     are supported as well as 113 of the 114 functions at the z/VM 6.1 level.
                     (Check_Authorization doesn't follow the same API as the rest.)
                  <p>I needed a few of the SMAPI functions for a project, but once I started,
                     I couldn't stop and it soon became a huge educational exercise as I
                     learned a lot of new bash scripting techniques.</p>
                  <p>I also wanted to see if I could do most of it in bash and not rely on
                     too many external programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was able to get away with only using 5
                     external programs and 2 of those could even be implemented in the script,
                     but I left them for speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5th is the IUCV helper utility embedded in
                     the script (build it using "smcli smiucv").</p>
