                  <p>The &quot;multiboot&quot; patch adds the ability to IPL different configurations from the same device using the LOADPARM parameter on VMs IPL command or the &quot;Load Parameter&quot; field on the Hardware Management Console.</p>
                  <p>It is especially useful when IPLing zLinux in an LPAR. You may setup several configs in /etc/zipl.conf, like a known good one, a test one, and one that IPLs into single user mode. Then, if something untoward happens while testing, you have alternatives to get zLinux back up.<br />
                    <br />
                    You can even maintain 1 zipl.conf to be used by several LPARs and/or VM guests.</p>
                  <p>The patch applies to <a href="http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/linux390/index.shtml">s390-tools-1.1.6</a>.</p>
