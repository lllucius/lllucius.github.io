                  <p>These scripts are some that I put together to help out with VIPA takeover.&nbsp; I wrote them for my own use, but since there didn't seem to be too many examples out in the wild, I figured I'd let them roam the net a bit.</p>
                  <p>They're not a &quot;be all, do all&quot; solution.&nbsp; They simply manage the failover from 1 QETH device to another.&nbsp; (If there is a simplier solution available, PLEASE let me know.&nbsp; I just couldn't find one.)</p>
                  <p>Anyway, take a look at the README file in the distro.&nbsp; It explains everything in more detail.</p>
