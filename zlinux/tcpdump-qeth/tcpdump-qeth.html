                  <h2>{{page.title}}</h2>
                  <p>This Perl program provides a wrapper for the tcpdump utility to allow capturing packets from qeth or hipersocket network interfaces.&nbsp; It injects a link-level header that is missing from captured packets produced by those interfaces.&nbsp; It was written by <a href="http://linuxvm.org/community/hsmolins.html">Holger Smolinski</a> of IBM and released under the GPL.</p>
                  <p>As distributed up to SLES 11 SP1, the program has a couple of minor issues and does not allow you to use any filter programs.&nbsp; With the exception of multiple &quot;d&quot; and &quot;v&quot; arguments, you may use all arguments as described by the tcpdump manpage.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p>You may either download the patch or a pre-patched version of the program.</p>
