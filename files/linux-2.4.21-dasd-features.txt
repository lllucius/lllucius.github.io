Here's a patch that "fixes" a few parsing problems in dasd.c and adds a couple of new
features.

The first addition is the ability to reserve devices for use by the DIAG dscipline.
You do this by adding "diag" to the feature list when adding ranges.

So, on the kernel command line you'd use:

    dasd=900-910(diag)

And in /proc/dasd/devices:

    add range=900-910(diag)

Either of these will prevent any other driver from commandeering the devices, thus reserving
them for the DIAG discipline.

The other addition is the ability to toggle the read-only and diag features of a range.  Just
echo the following to /proc/dasd/devices:

    readonly range=900-910 off
    readonly range=900-910 on
    usediag range=900-910 off
    usediag range=900-910 on

Here's a list of all the changes:

dasd.c/dasd_strtoul():
    (fix) handling of multiple range features was incorrect, ie:
          add range=900-910(ro:ro:ro:ro:ro)
    (fix) feature terminator (closing paren) would confuse "set" and "brk" routines, ie:
          set range=900(ro) on
    (add) DASD_FEATURE_USEDIAG handling

dasd.c/dasd_features_from_devno():
    (fix) unnecessary "devindex" code removed

dasd.c/dasd_find_disc():
    (add) DASD_FEATURE_USEDIAG handling

dasd.c/dasd_state_new_to_del():
    (add) DASD_FEATURE_USEDIAG handling

dasd.c/dasd_devices_open():
    (add) DASD_FEATURE_USEDIAG handling

dasd.c/dasd_parse_range():
    (add) moved range validation from proc_* handlers
    (fix) prevent swapped ranges, ie:
          range=910-900 

dasd.c/dasd_proc_set():
    (del) moved range validation to dasd_parse_range()
    (fix) don't allow settings like:
          set range=900-910 offfff
    (fix) "alowed" mispelled

dasd.c/dasd_proc_feature():
    (add) provide setting and unsetting of dasd features

dasd.c/dasd_proc_add():
    (del) moved range validation to dasd_parse_range()

dasd.c/dasd_devices_write():
    (add) provide setting "readonly" and "usediag" features, ie:
          readonly range=900-910 on
          usediag range=900-910 off

dasd.h:
    (add) new DASD_FEATURE_USEDIAG flag
