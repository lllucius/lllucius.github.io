 Obtaining a preapproval provides you with several advantages:
 
   Knowledge -- You will know exactly how much you can afford before you
                start home shopping.
 
   Competitive advantage -- Sellers and real estate agents will consider
                            you a serious buyer.
 
   Speeds time to closing -- Since you are preapproved you can move into
                             your dream home much faster!
 
   Closing cost credit -- The $60 application fee is applied toward your
                          closing cost.
 
 Our easy to use and secure online application was designed to guide your
 through the home financing process. Of course, if you have any questions
 or prefer to complete your application over the phone give us a call at
